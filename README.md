    Hi human!

    I admit, I did first start coding when websites were created using <font>,
    <markee>, and <blink> tags. Layouts were not coded with <div>, flex and
    grid layouts. They were made with many <table> tags. Slowly these web
    standards changed. It was great. However emails lacked behind for a
    long long time. Eventually they starting catching on, but here we
    are again. Maybe I'm being too creative, maybe I should keep it
    simple but these README files rendered on GitHub are stripped
    of style attributes (almost all, github.com/github/markup).

    I would like to embellish the profile a little bit more,
    but for the time being, I'll limit the hackery a bit.
    Going too far would impede on accessibility. This
    type of hacking also takes lots of time. So for
    now, I will say: enjoy and have a great day.
